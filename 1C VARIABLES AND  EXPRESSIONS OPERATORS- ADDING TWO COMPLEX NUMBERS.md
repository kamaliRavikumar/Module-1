# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To Write a python program for bitwise shift operators on the user given integers
## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user: one as num (the number) and the other as shift (the number of positions to shift).
3. Perform right shift: calculate right_shift = num >> shift.
4. Perform left shift: calculate left_shift = num << shift.
5. Print the results of both the right shift and left shift operations.
## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060109
#Name-kamali R
#Write your code here

num = int(input())
shift = int(input())

right_shift = num >> shift  
left_shift = num << shift    

print(right_shift)  
print(left_shift)  
```
