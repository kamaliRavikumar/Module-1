# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To Write a python program to read two numbers and convert and print them into a complex number and print the real and imaginary part of the complex number.

## ALGORITHM 

1. Start the program.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user (let them be a and b).
3. Convert the inputs into a complex number x = complex(a, b).
4. Display the complex number x.
5. Print the real part (x.real) and the imaginary part (x.imag) of the complex number.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060109
# Name-kamali R
# Write your code here

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)

```
